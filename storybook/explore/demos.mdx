# Demos

Here are a few demos with different configurations to showcase uses of diagrammer. Read more about diagrammer configurations [here](?path=/story/docs-usage-configuration--page).

* **[Left Right Rectangular](?path=/story/demos-diagrammer--left-right-rectangular)** : Uses a LeftRight connector placement with rectangular shape nodes by default.
* **[Top Bottom Rectangular](?path=/story/demos-diagrammer--top-bottom-rectangular)** : Uses a TopBottom connector placement with rectangular shape nodes by default.
* **[Boundary Circular](?path=/story/demos-diagrammer--boundary-circular)** : Uses a Boundary connector placement with circular shape nodes by default.
* **[Boundary Rectangular](?path=/story/demos-diagrammer--boundary-rectangular)** : Uses a Boundary connector placement with rectangular shape nodes.
* **[Layout](?path=/story/demos-diagrammer--layout)** : Uses an initial graph that is setup to test the layout APIs.
* **[Action Interceptor](?path=/story/demos-diagrammer--action-interceptor)** : Uses an action interceptor to add every new node that is dragged in with an extra attribute. The extra attribute is a boolean indicating whether the node that was dragged is an odd numbered new node or not. For rectangular nodes, the odd numbered nodes have a Red colored outline and the even numbered ones have a blue outline. Furthermore, when new edges are created, it creates the reverse edge 1 second later.
* **[Dark Theme](?path=/story/demos-diagrammer--dark-theme)** : Same as Left Right Rectangular demo with Dark Theme enabled.

The code for these demos can be found [here](https://github.com/sameergoyal/diagrammer/tree/master/integ).
