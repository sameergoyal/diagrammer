# Initialization

```javascript
import { Diagrammer } from "diagrammer";

const diagrammer = new Diagrammer(
  container,
  config,
  optionalParams // { initialData, eventListener, consumerRootReducer, consumerEnhancer }
);
```

The parameters required for the constructing an instance of Diagrammer are as follows. The type definitions can be found <a href="typedoc/classes/index.Diagrammer.html#constructor" target="_blank">here</a>.

* **Container**: Used to determine the DOM node where diagrammer should render. Could either be the DOM node itself or be the ID of the DOM node. If using the string ID, please ensure that the DOM node should be present in the page DOM at the time of initialization. Similarly, if using DOM node object, please ensure the object is part of the DOM at time of initialization.
* **Configuration**: Described in the [Configuration](?path=/story/docs-usage-configuration--page) section.
* **Optional Parameters** is an object that could contain params listed below:
  * **Initial Data**: This is an object describing the state that should be rendered when diagrammer initializes. Therefore, this must adhere to the object structure of the diagrammer state mentioned in the upcoming sections.
  * **Consumer Root Reducer**: This is a [redux](https://redux.js.org/) style [reducer](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers) that will get the current state & action and it could return new state based on these two params. This must adhere to the same rules as a redux reducer, namely shallow immutability. Also, note that current state is already modified in case the action was initiated by diagrammer itself. In case, it was a custom action fired using the API, this is the original state instead of the modified state.
  * **Consumer Enhancer**: This is a [redux](https://redux.js.org/) style [enhancer](https://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware) that is applied to our underlying store. This is useful for enabling debugging tools like Redux dev tools extension, or used by plugins. In most cases, there should be no need for a consumer to write an enhancer by hand.
  * **Event Listener**: This is a listener that is invoked on all events flowing through the UI events stream. This is useful when you want to use the library's inbuilt UI events module to detect, normalize and fire UI events for DOM that was not rendered by diagrammer. This can be used to listen to events and then dispatch actions on the store. Useful for plugins.

## Initialization for React/Preact

For integrating diagrammer into your React/Preact application, consider creating a wrapper component that instantiates and contains the diagrammer instance.

```javascript
import { Component } from 'react';
import { Diagrammer, DiagrammerConfig, DiagrammerData } from 'diagrammer';

interface MyNodeType {
  // Based on use case or leave empty
  ...
}

interface MyEdgeType {
  // Based on use case or leave empty
  ...
}

interface DiagrammerContainerProps {
  config: DiagrammerConfig<MyNodeType, MyEdgeType>;
  initialData: DiagrammerData<MyNodeType, MyEdgeType>
}

export class DiagrammerContainer extends Component<DiagrammerContainerProps> {
  private diagrammer: Diagrammer<MyNodeType, MyEdgeType>;
  private container: HTMLElement;

  componentDidMount() {
    this.diagrammer = new Diagrammer(
      this.container,
      this.props.config,
      // { initialData, eventListener, consumerRootReducer, consumerEnhancer }
      {
        initialData: this.props.initialData
      }
    );
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.diagrammer.destroy();
  }

  render() {
    return <div ref={(element) => this.container = element} />;
  }
}
```

## Importing Styles

All the above steps help you integrate Diagrammer into your application, but it doesnt render properly without the styles. For importing the styles add this to your application's entry point.

```javascript
import "diagrammer/dist/diagrammer.css";
```

## Dark Theme

Diagrammer also provide a Dark Theme in case your app needs a Dark Mode UI. To enable it just add a class `dm-dark-theme` to the root container or `body` HTML element.

```html
<div id="diagrammerContainer" class="dm-dark-theme"></div>
```

An example of Dark Theme can be found in **[Dark Theme](?path=/story/demos-diagrammer--dark-theme)** demo.
